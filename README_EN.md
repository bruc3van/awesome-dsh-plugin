## ⭐ Featured picks

**These are not ranked by stars.** We prioritize projects that solve a clear problem, document themselves well, are still maintained, and are representative — so you will find 1k-star projects next to a few-dozen-star one that has no substitute. Start from your problem, find the closest line, and the answer is one click away. Inclusion is not an endorsement of security or compatibility. For the full star-ranked board, see the [Community leaderboard](#-community-leaderboard).

### 🖥️ Desktop & terminal

- **Want a standalone desktop client** instead of a browser tab: [dsh-desktop](https://github.com/bruc3van/dsh-desktop) — Out-of-the-box: auto-reuse a running local instance or launch the bundled runtime with no Node.js/CLI install, plus remote connections, tray residency, and crash recovery.
- **Want a Claude Code-style terminal UI**: [dsh-TUI](https://github.com/ccch1mneyyy/dsh-TUI) · [dsh-tianshu-tui](https://github.com/huiliyi37/dsh-tianshu-tui) — Full-screen interactive terminals with a live status line, thought streaming, and context/TPS gauges; the tianshu build adds TDD and evidence-gate workflows.

### 🧰 Interface workbenches

- **Want one install that covers common UI needs**: [dsh-web-ui](https://github.com/zhu1090093659/dsh-web-ui) — Task board, Git graph, side panel, remote mobile UI, desktop pet, live token stats, and a skin center in one collection.
- **Want to see what is inside the context window**: [dsh-context](https://github.com/bowenliang123/dsh-context) — A Context tab in the Web UI showing what the model's context window is made of and how it evolves — helps time trimming and token control.
- **Want to turn the sidebar into a workbench**: [DSH-better-sidebar](https://github.com/omdsh-dev/DSH-better-sidebar) — File rendering/editing, terminal, Git, and subagents built in, with third-party tab extensions.
- **Want to inspect and operate the current web page from your dev conversation**: [dsh-browser](https://github.com/Lum1104/dsh-browser) — A Chrome side-panel extension that lets DSH operate your browser directly, with no vision capabilities required: grant the current tab and let DSH read and act on the page inside your existing conversation.

### 👀 Let the model see and search

- **Want to add visual understanding to DSH**: [modlens](https://github.com/liustack/modlens) · [dsh-vision-toolkit](https://github.com/Anionex/dsh-vision-toolkit) — modlens turns images into structured OCR/layout/semantics evidence; dsh-vision-toolkit covers image Q&A, long-screenshot OCR, UI restoration, and pixel diffs.
- **Want paste-and-go vision with no key and no Python**: [dsh-vision-router](https://github.com/ysr666/dsh-vision-router) — a built-in free vision chain (five-model anonymous fallback, no signup or key); image turns work like ordinary tool turns, with the model driving 10 `vision_*` pixel tools (ground, crop, describe, pixel diff, fix, palette, OCR, cutout, SVG trace, screenshot) in continuous multi-step sequences, plus structured evidence JSON; one-command install (Web profile), Node only.
- **Want the agent to search the web and X with citations**: [modsearch](https://github.com/liustack/modsearch) · [anysearch-dsh](https://github.com/anysearch-team/anysearch-dsh) — modsearch searches and fetches from the web/X inline, returning cited structured evidence; anysearch-dsh adds the AnySearch provider and advanced search tools as a complementary backend.

- **Want to wake an agent on a schedule or event**: [dsh-loop](https://github.com/vlln/dsh-loop) · [dsh-sentinel](https://github.com/fuhefei/dsh-sentinel) — Scheduled runs plus file, command, HTTP, process, and webhook events.
- **Requests keep dying to network hiccups and timeouts**, and you do not want to say "continue" by hand every time: [dsh-auto-continue](https://github.com/HsiangNianian/dsh-auto-continue) — Auto-sends a queued "continue" after non-human failures: error classification resumes only transient faults, adaptive backoff avoids hammering a broken upstream, and templated continue text keeps you in the loop — all configurable from the plugin settings card.
- **Want to rewind conversation and workspace state**: [dsh-turn-rewind](https://github.com/Anionex/dsh-turn-rewind) — Rewind to any earlier turn via a persistent Change Ledger, restoring both conversation and workspace state.
- **Want a desktop notification when a turn finishes**: [dsh-notification](https://github.com/omdsh-dev/dsh-notification) — Per-outcome notifications with keyword include/exclude rules so long tasks need no babysitting.

### ✍️ Conversation details

- **Want to reference workspace files with @ mentions, like Codex**: [dsh-at-file](https://github.com/omdsh-dev/dsh-at-file) — @-search workspace files in the composer and attach their contents to the prompt, no copy-paste needed.

### 🎨 Creation & fun

- **Want interactive UI rendered in chat**: [dsh-genui](https://github.com/omdsh-dev/dsh-genui) — Charts, forms, quizzes, Mermaid diagrams, and 3D scenes rendered inline.
- **Want agents to operate a real design canvas**: [dsh-openpencil](https://github.com/ZSeven-W/dsh-openpencil) — Create, edit, preview, and validate interactive multi-page OpenPencil designs.
- **Want a companion in the workspace**: [whale-girl](https://github.com/vlln/whale-girl) — A draggable, feedable, playable desktop companion with persistent progression.
- **Want to change the skin / set a custom wallpaper**: [dsh-skin](https://github.com/KinGao294/dsh-skin) · [dsh-deep-whale](https://github.com/Small-tailqwq/dsh-deep-whale) — dsh-skin switches --dsw-alias-* palettes and translucent wallpapers (Codex-style); dsh-deep-whale is the most popular whale-girl skin series (CC BY-NC-SA, non-commercial).

### 🔌 Remote & external collaboration

- **Want an external agent to drive Harness**: [dsh-harness-mcp-server](https://github.com/chushixixin/dsh-harness-mcp-server) — Runs an MCP server inside Harness so any MCP client (e.g. Hermes) can delegate coding tasks to Harness — a 'brain + arms' setup.
- **Want to access your local Harness securely from another device**: [dsh-remote](https://github.com/flymysql/dsh-remote) — Prints the exact commands for the live instance — SSH local forward, autossh keepalive, NAT-friendly reverse tunnel, and reverse-proxy access with --trusted-host — with one-click copy from the settings page. Respects the official safety design: no 0.0.0.0 hacks.

## 📣 Author showcase


Self-submitted recommendations from plugin authors, following the [contributing rules](./CONTRIBUTING.md#作者自荐--self-promotion). **These entries are not editorially reviewed and carry no quality or security endorsement** — evaluate them yourself before installing (see Usage & safety below). At most 30 entries are kept — first in, first out; entries promoted to the [Featured picks](#-featured-picks) above are removed from this section without using a slot. The home page shows only the **10 most recent entries**; the complete list lives in [SHOWCASE.md](./SHOWCASE.md).

- **[dsh-tray](https://github.com/KAIbsb/dsh-tray)** ([@KAIbsb](https://github.com/KAIbsb) · 2026-08-15) — A Windows tray manager for DSH Web: one-click start/restart/stop, crash auto-restart, whale status icon, and autostart — pairs nicely with a browser app-mode window.

- **[dsh-auto-review](https://github.com/PerryLink/dsh-auto-review)** ([@PerryLink](https://github.com/PerryLink) · 2026-08-15) — Second-model AI auto-review on the approval answerer chain: a read-only reviewer subagent returns structured allow/deny verdicts with reasons and risk levels, fail-closed by default, with a full session-log audit trail; /auto-review command + Web review panel, npm-installable, pairs with dsh-permission-rules for a rules-first, AI-backstop loop.
- **[dsh-lsp-actions](https://github.com/PerryLink/dsh-lsp-actions)** ([@PerryLink](https://github.com/PerryLink) · 2026-08-15) — The LSP action surface for DeepSeek Harness: diagnostics, formatting, completion, code actions, symbols, signature help, inlay hints, and rename tools backed by real language servers; writes go through write-intent and the sandbox policy, everything else is read-only.
- **[dsh-doc-share](https://github.com/dawsondx/dsh-doc-share)** ([@dawsondx](https://github.com/dawsondx) · 2026-08-15) — Turns a DSH conversation into a formatted report with a cover, summary stats and per-turn chapters: turn-selector dialog (search / select-all / load older history), single-turn quick share, gen-UI rich components supported, and one-shot export to PNG / standalone HTML / PDF / Markdown.
- **[dsh-llm-ollama](https://github.com/NOirBRight/dsh-llm-ollama)** ([@NOirBRight](https://github.com/NOirBRight) · 2026-08-15) — Ollama Cloud native chat adapter: registers an `ollama-cloud` LLM route with native model discovery (context windows, vision, thinking, tools) and web search/fetch providers.

Zero runtime dependencies, no dsh code changed, data served on the product’s own origin under `/abyss`.
- **[dsh-mcp-lens](https://github.com/labmimors/dsh-mcp-lens)** ([@labmimors](https://github.com/labmimors) · 2026-08-15) — Keeps a large MCP catalog behind two model-visible interfaces, `mcp_search` and `mcp_call`, reveals a small set of exact schemas on demand, and applies the same `allowTools` / `denyTools` policy to search and calls; for DSH users connecting dozens to thousands of MCP tools, with a local schema-byte calculator and CI budget Action.
- **[dsh-movein](https://github.com/sjh9714/dsh-movein)** ([@sjh9714](https://github.com/sjh9714) · 2026-08-16) — Moves a whole Claude Code setup into DSH in one command: skills, MCP servers, hooks, subagents and permission rules (deny/ask bridge with a migration diff report), dry run by default; `--reverse` since v0.4 brings DSH-born skills back, dual boot instead of a one-way move.

## 🔍 How this list is maintained

- **Built for users, not crawlers:** the front page is organized around "what I want to get done", not hundreds of repo names.
- **Layered: human picks + full index:** the front page carries only hand-screened featured picks and the showcase preview; [CATALOG.md](./CATALOG.md) lists every verified repository; new repositories first enter the [review queue](./data/review/pending.md) and appear after verification and merge (convention: [data/review/README.md](./data/review/README.md)).
- **Automated data, human pages:** the raw snapshot and the review queue refresh daily by script; the catalog and Top 200 leaderboard are regenerated only after a human review merge (generators: [scripts/merge.mjs](./scripts/merge.mjs), [scripts/top.mjs](./scripts/top.mjs), switchable back to Top 100); the home-page featured picks, showcase, and recently-joined sections are edited by hand, so polluted API data (star inflation, topic riders) never rewrites recommendations automatically.
- **Riders removed:** repositories carrying the `dsh-plugin` topic without being DSH plugins (the platform itself, other agent tools, competing catalogs) and editorially blacklisted repositories are excluded from the catalog and leaderboard, with per-repo reasons recorded in [data/curated.json](./data/curated.json) (the leaderboard additionally honors `leaderboard_exclusions` for repos that stay in the catalog but do not rank) — auditable and contestable at any time.
- **Downstream market file:** [data/market.json](./data/market.json) is the curated file downstream markets consume (e.g. the DSH desktop plugin market): the snapshot plus curation, filtered, cleaned, and dealt round-robin across categories (≤300 rows, ≤500 KB). It is rebuilt on every daily snapshot refresh and immediately after every curation merge; the field and generation rules live in the downstream [publishing spec](https://github.com/bruc3van/dsh-desktop-safe-market/blob/master/docs/market-json-spec.md). The same runs also publish [MARKET.md](./MARKET.md), a read-only star-ranked rendering of the file for previewing the market on GitHub without installing anything.
- **Chinese by default, bilingual:** native readability for the main audience, with a dedicated English entry point.

As of 2026-08-16, the catalog lists **3,408** repositories across **22** primary languages; **2,939** declare a license and **3,400** are neither archived nor disabled (the catalog updates after each human review merge — see [CATALOG.md](./CATALOG.md) for current numbers).

## ⚠️ Usage & safety

Third-party plugins can read conversations, files, network traffic, or system resources. Before installing, check the source, permissions, license, install method, and recent activity — and try new plugins in an isolated environment first. This list is for discovery and organization only; it is not affiliated with or endorsed by DSH, and inclusion is not a security or compatibility endorsement.

- **Get your plugin listed:** a public repo tagged `dsh-plugin` that is actually a DSH plugin enters the [review queue](./data/review/pending.md) on the next daily refresh and appears in the full catalog after we verify it — **no PR to this repo needed**. Topic riders are removed, with reasons recorded in [data/curated.json](./data/curated.json).
- **Self-promote as an author:** if you own the plugin, append one entry (Chinese and English) to [SHOWCASE.md](./SHOWCASE.md) following the [contributing rules](./CONTRIBUTING.md#作者自荐--self-promotion) and sync the home-page showcase preview to the 10 most recent entries — no editorial review needed.
- **Get on the front page:** the featured picks and recently-joined sections are hand-maintained — open an Issue telling us what problem it solves and for whom, or edit the corresponding Markdown directly with your reasoning. The leaderboard [TOP200.md](./TOP200.md) is generated by script; to keep a repository out of the board, register it under `leaderboard_exclusions` in [data/curated.json](./data/curated.json) with a reason.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
